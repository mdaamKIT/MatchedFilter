Progress Bar
------------
[cosmetic] After finishing the processes with a progress bar (Matched Filtering or Template Creation), an empty progress bar pops up multiple times.

Running docker as root
----------------------
The docker containers are run by root user. This means that the files created are owned by root and can't be changed easily by a non-root user. Especially the 00_progress_mf.dat and 00_progress_create.dat files to report the status of the processes of Matched Filtering or Template Creation to the progress bar do not get removed automatically.
I tried to solve this issue but I did not find a flexible solution that works on any machine. I only found solutions that would require to write (hard code) the alternate (non-root) user id somewhere, either in the communicate_to_mpi_windows.MPIConnection.run() command by using the user="uid:gid" parameter or in the docker-file. In the docker-file it should even be possible to be a little more flexible to write the id of the user compiling the docker-file into the docker-image. (Maybe that is nonsense.) That solution would anyway require the user to compile the docker-file by themselves. Facing those alternatives, I chose to keep going with the minor problem of having all those files owned by root. (Maybe that is not ideal from a security standpoint, but I did not expect my software to be used in very sensitive contexts. Feel free to change this behaviour in your copy of the software.)
- All of this does not seem to be a problem on windows machines. Maybe the docker client is handling those issues well on windows?
(maybe I should just use podman?)





only in MacOS
=============

The entire software has never been tested on MacOS. No idea what will work.

Problems could be similar to those on linux?
